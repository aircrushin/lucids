# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for implementing comprehensive unit testing across the project. Unit testing will ensure individual components function correctly in isolation, improve code quality, catch regressions early, and provide documentation of expected component behavior. The implementation will focus on setting up the testing framework, writing tests for existing components, and establishing best practices for future development.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to set up a testing framework, so that I can write and run unit tests for the project components.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the project is cloned THEN the developer SHALL be able to install all testing dependencies with a single command
2. WHEN the developer runs the test command THEN the system SHALL execute all unit tests
3. WHEN tests are executed THEN the system SHALL provide clear pass/fail results and test coverage metrics
4. WHEN a test fails THEN the system SHALL provide detailed error information to help debugging

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to write unit tests for React components, so that I can ensure they render correctly and handle user interactions as expected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing a React component THEN the system SHALL verify the component renders without errors
2. WHEN testing a React component THEN the system SHALL verify the component displays the expected content
3. WHEN testing interactive components THEN the system SHALL verify user interactions trigger the expected behavior
4. WHEN testing components with props THEN the system SHALL verify the component handles different prop values correctly
5. WHEN testing components with state THEN the system SHALL verify state changes occur as expected

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to write unit tests for utility functions and hooks, so that I can ensure they work correctly in isolation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing utility functions THEN the system SHALL verify they return expected outputs for given inputs
2. WHEN testing functions with edge cases THEN the system SHALL verify they handle edge cases correctly
3. WHEN testing custom hooks THEN the system SHALL verify they manage state and side effects as expected
4. WHEN testing functions that handle errors THEN the system SHALL verify they handle errors appropriately

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to mock external dependencies in tests, so that I can test components in isolation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing components that use external APIs THEN the system SHALL provide a way to mock API responses
2. WHEN testing components that use context providers THEN the system SHALL provide a way to mock context values
3. WHEN testing components that use routing THEN the system SHALL provide a way to mock routing functionality
4. WHEN testing components that use third-party libraries THEN the system SHALL provide a way to mock those dependencies

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to integrate testing into the development workflow, so that tests are run automatically before code is merged.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is pushed to the repository THEN the system SHALL automatically run tests
2. WHEN a pull request is created THEN the system SHALL display test results in the PR
3. WHEN tests fail in a PR THEN the system SHALL prevent merging until tests pass
4. WHEN new code is added THEN the system SHALL enforce minimum test coverage requirements

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to establish testing best practices and documentation, so that the team follows consistent testing patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer needs to write tests THEN the system SHALL provide documentation on testing patterns and best practices
2. WHEN a new component is created THEN the developer SHALL have clear guidelines on how to test it
3. WHEN test coverage is below the threshold THEN the system SHALL identify which parts of the code need more tests
4. WHEN tests are written THEN they SHALL follow consistent naming and organization patterns
